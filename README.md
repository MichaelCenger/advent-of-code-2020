This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/).
Beware that all code was written for a competition where the fastest submission netted the most points, so the code is messy in certain areas.
This is more so just to show my ability of solving complex problems quickly and does not resemble my ability to write clean and structured code.
With this code I ranked 1st out of 69 participants on the leaderboard of my university.
